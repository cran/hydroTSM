\title{
Hours in Period
}
\description{
Given any starting and ending date/time objects, it generates:  \cr
1) a vector of class c("POSIXct" "POSIXt") with all the hours between the two date/time objects (both of them included), OR \cr
2) the amount of hours between the two date/time objects 
}
\usage{
hip(from, to, date.fmt="\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H", out.type = "seq")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{from}{
Character or POSIXct object indicating the starting date/time for creating the sequence. It has to be in the format indicated by \code{date.fmt}.
}
  \item{to}{
Character indicating the ending date/time for creating the sequence. It has to be in the format indicated by \code{date.fmt}.
}
  \item{date.fmt}{
character indicating the format in which the date/time objects are stored in \code{from} and \code{to}, e.g. \kbd{\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M}. See \code{format} in \code{\link[base]{as.Date}}. \cr
ONLY required when \code{class(dates)=="factor"} or \code{class(dates)=="numeric"}.
}
  \item{out.type}{
Character indicating the type of result that is given by this function. Valid values are: \cr
1) \kbd{seq} : a vector of class Date with all the days between the two dates, OR \cr
2) \kbd{nmbr}: a single numeric value with the amount of days between the two dates.
}

\value{
Depending on the value of \code{out.type}, it returns: \cr
1) a vector of class \code{c("POSIXct" "POSIXt")} with all the hours between \code{from} and \code{to} (both of them included), OR \cr
2) the amount of hours between the two date/time objects
