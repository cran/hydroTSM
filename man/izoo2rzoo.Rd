\title{
 Irregular Zoo -> Regular Zoo
}
\description{
It takes an irregular zoo object (with non-existing values for some dates) and converts it into a regularly spaced zoo object within the time period defined by \code{from} and \code{to}, by filling the missing dates with \sQuote{NA}
}
\usage{
izoo2rzoo(x, ...)

\method{izoo2rzoo}{default}(x, from= start(x), to= end(x), date.fmt= "\%Y-\%m-\%d", tstep= "days", ...)
     
\method{izoo2rzoo}{zoo}(x, from= start(x), to= end(x), date.fmt= "\%Y-\%m-\%d", tstep= "days", ...)

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
irregular zoo object (vector or matrix) representing a time series (very likely read with some user-defined procedure, and with some missing values for particular days/months/years)
}
  \item{from}{
Character indicating the starting date for creating the regularly spaced zoo object. The default value corresponds to the date of the first element of \code{x} \cr
It has to be in the format indicated by \code{date.fmt}. 
}
  \item{to}{
Character indicating the ending date for creating the regularly spaced zoo object. The default value corresponds to the date of the last element of \code{x} \cr
It has to be in the format indicated by \code{date.fmt}.
}
  \item{date.fmt}{
character indicating the format in which the dates are stored in \code{from} and \code{to}, e.g. \kbd{\%Y-\%m-\%d}. See \sQuote{Details} section in \code{\link[base]{strptime}} 
}
  \item{tstep}{
character, indicating the time step used for creating the time sequence going from \code{from} to \code{to} that will be used as \code{time(x)} \cr
Valid values are (but not limited to) \kbd{days}, \kbd{months}, \kbd{years}, \kbd{hours}
}
  \item{\dots}{
further arguments passed to or from other methods
}
}
\details{
If the full time period of \code{x} is a subset of the time period defined by \code{from} and \code{to}, the time period of the resulting zoo is the one defined by \code{from} and \code{to}, assigning 'NA' to all the dates in which \code{x} do not have a value.
}
\value{
a regularly spaced zoo object, with values given by \code{x} and time stamps going from \code{from} to \code{to} at intervals defined by \code{tsteps}

## Example 1: Adding NA for February 29th to an existing zoo object

# dummy values and dates (February 29th is not present !)
x <- 1:9
dates <- c("1964-02-25", "1964-02-26", "1964-02-27", "1964-02-28", "1964-03-01", 
           "1964-03-02", "1964-03-03", "1964-03-04", "1964-03-05")

# From 'character' to 'Date' class
dates <- as.Date(dates)

## From 'numeric' to 'zoo' class
x <- zoo(x, dates) # Feb 29th is still missing

## Adding a missing value (NA in this case) for Feb 29th
y <- izoo2rzoo(x)

## checking the new length
length(y) # 1 element more than the original 'x' (Feb 29th)


##
## Example 2: Extending the original 'x' object from February 1st to the end of 
#  March, assigning 'NA' to the days in which 'x' do not have a value.
y <- izoo2rzoo(x, from="1964-02-01", to="1964-03-31")


##
## Example 3: Working with a zoo matrix
Y <- cbind(x,x)

# Adding a missing value (NA in this case) for Feb 29th in all the columns of Y
rY <- izoo2rzoo(Y, from="1964-02-25", to="1964-03-05")


##
## Example 4: Working with hourly data, from 01:00 to 10:00 on 12th December 2000
dates  <- ISOdatetime(2000, 12, 12, 1:10, 0, 0)
values <- 1:10
x      <- zoo(values, dates)

# removing values from 02:00 to 05:00 (not present at all in 'x', not even NA !)
x <- x[-c(2:5)]

#  Adding missing values (NA in this case) from 02:00 to 05:00
y <-  izoo2rzoo(x, date.fmt="\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S", tstep="hours")
