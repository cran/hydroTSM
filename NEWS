                         -) updated vignette. Now it includes some examples about computation of extreme indices of daily precipitation.
                         -) new dataset: 'KarameaAtGorgeQts', with hourly streamflows for the Karamea River(New Zeland), provided by the 
                            National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (http://www.niwa.co.nz/), thanks to the kind collaboration 
                            of Shailesh Singh.
                         -) e-mail address of maintainer was changed from the @ing.unit.it to the @gmail.com domain

                            package
 
        o new function: 'subdaily2daily' for aggregating sub-daily values into daily ones
        o new function: 'subdaily2monthly' for computing monthly values from sub-daily time series        
        o new function: 'subdaily2annual' for computing annual values from sub-daily time series 
        o new function: 'subdaily2seasonal' for computing seasonal values for every year of a sub-daily time series
        o new function: 'hip' for creating a sequence (or counting the number) of hours between two date/time objects   
        o 'sname2plot'                 : -) new argument 'season.names', to customise the names of the weather seasons used for plotting 
                                         -) default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)  
        o 'hydroplot'                  : new argument 'season.names', to customise the names of the weather seasons used for plotting 
        o 'daily2monthly'              : now it handles sub-daily and weekly values         
        o 'daily2annual'               : now it handles sub-daily, weekly and quarterly values      
        o 'monthlyfunction'            : now it handles sub-daily values 
        o 'dm2seasonal'                : -) now it handles sub-daily and weekly values 
                                         -) improved examples
        o 'time2season'                : now it handles "POSIXct" and "POSIXt" values       
        o 'seasonalfunction.zoo'       : season names are now correctly given (instead of just numbers) for zoo objects that are matrix/data.frame 
                                         as well
        o 'annualfunction.zoo'         : 'na.rm' argument is now used when the input zoo object is a matrix/data.frame (previously a single value 
                                          of 1 was artificially introduced to the annual ts of each column when 'na.rm=TRUE', while a single value 
                                          of 0 was artificially introduced to the annual ts of each column when 'na.rm=FALSE') => generally a very 
                                          small difference
        o 'dip'                        : more informative error messages

        o 'monthlyfunction.matrix'     : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
        o 'monthlyfunction.data.frame' : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)  
        o 'annualfunction.matrix'      : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
        o 'annualfunction.data.frame'  : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)  
        o 'seasonalfunction.matrix'    : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
        o 'seasonalfunction.data.frame': default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)                                              
        o 'daily2annual.matrix'        : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
        o 'daily2annual.data.frame'    : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)   
        o 'daily2monthly.matrix'       : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
        o 'daily2monthly.data.frame'   : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)  
        o 'dm2seasonal.matrix'         : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
        o 'dm2seasonal.data.frame'     : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing) 
        o 'hydrokrige.data.frame'      : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)    
        o 'sname2ts'                   : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)  
        o 'zoo2RHtest'                 : broken links were removed and replaced by new ones. Thanks to Gang Dong and Yan Li !
        o NAMESPACE                    : functions from packages zoo and xts are now imported explicitly
