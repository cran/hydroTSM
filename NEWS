NEWS/ChangeLog for hydroTSM
--------------------------

	
0.3-1	14-Sep-2011
        o hydroTSM 0.3-X is now compatible with R 2.12.X.
          'sp::coordinates' & 'sp::proj4string' were replaced by 'coordinates' & 'proj4string', respectively. Thanks to Uwe Ligges.
        o 'smry' : bugfix in 'smry.data.frame' (when -at least- 1 column was not numeric)
	
0.3-0	01-Sep-2011

	o hydroTSM now depends on xts >= 0.8-2 (=> zoo >= 1.7-2), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
	  The first release of 'xts' after the 0.8-0 (which was set as the default building block for plotting time series in hydroTSM) 
	  was the 0.8-2, and appeared on CRAN on August 9th, 2011	
	o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency of packages e1071, gstat, automap, sp
	o 'maptools' package is now "suggested" instead of a dependence. It is only used for reading shapefiles in the 
	  'hydrokrige' and 'mspplot' functions.	
	o 'drawxaxis'       : -) it was re-written, in order to take advantage of some features of the 'xts' 
			         package (now added as a dependence), and now it should work with sub-daily 
			         time series.
			      -) its name was changed from 'drawxaxis' to 'drawTimeAxis', in order to have a 
			         more intuitive name. The old 'drawxaxis' function is deprecated, but 
			         still be kept for back-compatibility reasons.			
	 		      -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		         "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto".
	o 'hydroplot'       : -) it takes advantage of the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
	  'sname2plot'      : -) now it is able to plot seasonal values (ptype="seasonal")
	                      -) it works with xts objects as well.
			      -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		         "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 		      -) the name of 'x' is now used as default for the Y axis label.
	 		      -) an incorrect default title for the daily histogram was fixed.
	 		      -) the default value for 'cex' was changed from 0.7 to 0.3
	 		      -) new arguments: 'from', 'to', for plotting a slice of the original time series
	 		      -) thanks to Tom Elliott for pointing out my attention to this function again !.
	 		      -) new argument: 'h', for plotting horizontal lines in seasonal plots
	 		      -) new argument 'stype', for allowing weather seasons different from 
	                         c("DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON") (thanks to Lydie Sichoix !)
	                      -) default value for the 'win.len1' argument was changed from 351*1 to 0, in order to avoid the 
	                         plotting of the 1-year moving average (by default)
	                      -) default value for the 'win.len2' argument was changed from 351*3 to 0, in order to avoid the 
	                         plotting of the 3-years moving average (by default)
	o 'hydroplot'       : -) new argument: 'date.fmt' for being used with the new arguments 'from' and 'to'
	o 'sfreq'           : -) it works now with xts objects
	o 'vector2zoo'      : -) added error checking for length of the numeric vector and the dates.
	o 'hydrokrige'      : -) updated documentation and new example of interpolation over a user-defined raster map.
	o 'monthlyfunction' : -) new 'monthlyfunction.zoo', ~ 8 times faster than before (for data.frames, when out.type="data.frame")
			      -) it works now with matrix objects as well.
	                      -) it works now with xts objects as well.
	o 'annualfunction'  : -) new 'annualfunction.zoo', much faster than before for data.frames.

			      -) it works withannualxts objects as well.	 
	o 'daily2annual'    : -) new 'daily2monthly.zoo', much faster than before (for data.frames, when out.type="data.frame")
			      -) it works with xts objects as well.			                           	
	o 'fdc' and 'fdcu'  : -) new argument 'xat', for setting the position of the 'x' axis labels when 'log="x"'
	o 'time2season'     : -) new argument 'type', for allowing seasons different from 
	                         c("DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON") (thanks to Lydie Sichoix !)
	o 'dm2seasonal'     : -) new argument 'out.fmt', for better compatibility with zoo and xts objects.
	                      -) it works with matrix objects as well.
	                      -) it works with xts objects as well.
	                      -) argument 'season' now allows weather seasons typical from 
	                         French Polynesia: c("DJFM", "AM", "JJAS", "ON") (thanks to Lydie Sichoix !)

	                      -) new argument 'type', for allowing weather seasons different from

        o 'extractzoo'      : -) its name was changed from 'extractzoo' to 'extract', in order to have a 
			         shorter name (this function only apply to zoo objects anyway). 
			         The old 'extractzoo' function is deprecated, but still be kept for back-compatibility reasons.			
			      -) new 'extract.zoo'
			      -) argument 'trgt' now allows weather seasons typical from 
	                         French Polynesia: c("DJFM", "AM", "JJAS", "ON") (thanks to Lydie Sichoix !)

			      -) it works with xts objects as well.
